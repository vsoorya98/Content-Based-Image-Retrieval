The operating I used is Ubuntu 22 and I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE 



Instructions for running the executables:

Note: Make sure the image folder is saved in the same location as this program file 
First to run the main.cpp, In a terminal first type 'make' then type './main' followed by the image directory './image_directory' then the target image from the directory './image_directory/image_name'
for example :--> ./main ./olympus ./olympus/pic.0537.jpg  

Instructions for testing my code:

Once you enter the command mentioned above, it will ask the type of feature extraction you want to perform as mentioned below

EXPECTED OUTPUT :
Enter the type of feature extraction process you want 
A: Center 50*50 as the first Histogram and whole image RGB as the second histogram 
B: Multi Histogram Matching  
C: Texture and color 
D: Extension (3 Histogram) 
E: Baseline Matching  
F: Histogram Matching 

As mentioned for 

Task 1: Enter 'E' or 'e' to perform Baseline matching 

Task 2: Enter 'F' or 'f' to perform Histogram Matching 

Task 3: Enter 'B' or 'b' to perform Multi Histogram Matching 

Task 4: Enter 'C' or 'c' to perform Texture and color

Task 5: Enter 'A' or 'a' to perform Center 50*50 as the first Histogram and whole image RGB as the second histogram 

Extension: Enter 'D' or 'd' to perform Triple Histogram matching
